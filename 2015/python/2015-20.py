    elf_limit implements a limit to the number of houses each elf visits,

    Each house is visited by numbered elves which match the divisors of
    house_number, and each elf delivers a quantity of presents that
    match the elfâ€™s number times by presents_per_elf.

    For instance, given:
        house_number == 9
        presents_per_elf == 10
    The divisors (and therefore the elves) are:
        [1, 3, 9]
    And the presents delivered by each:
        [10, 30, 90]
